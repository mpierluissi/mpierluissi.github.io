			Foley Artist and Sound Designer with over 5 years of music theory, recording art, and post-production experience. Constantly driven to learn and grow in tandem with the ever-expanding world of audio technology. Quick to adapt to new workflows, DAWs, and both analog or digital audio systems.<br><br>
			
			My passion for sound began in primary school, where I was the principle Flautist in Vicksburg Community Schools. After taking part in multiple musical productions on and off stage, Western Michigan University (WMU) was my first choice for higher education.<br><br>
			
			At WMU, I majored in Multimedia Arts Technology. During that time, I acquired a deep-leveled understanding of recording arts and signal flow using an Otari Series 54 board located in Western Sound Studios (WSS). During my time at WMU, I was also employed as a streaming engineer. While I operated 2 cameras, I was responsible for working closely with the scheduled WSS engineer to provide high-quality audio/video streaming for distance music recitals to the Dalton School of Music YouTube page.<br><br>
			
			After recieving my Bachelor of Science in Multimedia Arts Techonology, I discovered the incredible work and environment of the Savannah College of Art & Design, where I am currently a Sound Design M.A. student.
